# drive — working notes for the next session

A mobile-first pixel-art driving game rendering real OSM, DEM and WorldCover
data. Deployed as a parc.land cell at https://c15r-drive.on.parc.land.

This file is the stuff that cost previous sessions hours to learn. It is not a
tour of the code — the code carries its own reasoning in long comment blocks,
and those comments are the primary documentation. Read the block above a
function before changing it; most of them exist because the obvious change was
tried and was wrong.

---

## The deploy ritual

The cell is deployed from `/home/user/workspace` (the cwd matters — `cell-sync`
resolves paths from the repo root, and running it from `cells/drive` fails with
a confusing module error):

1. `mcp__Substate__act` → `auth.mintToken`
   `{scope: "write:workspace cells:create", label, expiresInSec}`
2. `PARC_TOKEN=<tok> node scripts/cell-sync.mjs pull drive` — **always**, see below
3. `PARC_TOKEN=<tok> node scripts/cell-sync.mjs push drive --deploy`
4. `auth.revokeToken {tokenId}` — do not leave a token open
5. Verify by fetching the live bundle and grepping for a symbol you just added:
   `curl -s https://c15r-drive.on.parc.land/app.js | grep -c mySymbol`

### PULL BEFORE YOU PUSH. ALWAYS.

`cell-sync push` sends **every file in the cell**. Other agents edit the
deployed cell's source directly — during one session the hydro author was
iterating on `client/hydro/*` continuously — so pushing without pulling first
silently overwrites work that exists nowhere else.

The routine that survives this:

```
pull  →  git status  →  for each modified file, decide who owns it
      →  git checkout -- <files you own>        (restore yours)
      →  keep theirs, git add + commit verbatim (so it cannot be lost)
      →  tsc  →  push --deploy
```

Commit other people's pulled work with a message that says plainly it is not
yours and where it came from. It has happened repeatedly that the cell was
**ahead of git** — their work lived only on the deployed cell until a pull
rescued it.

The reverse also happens: the cell can be **behind** git when someone commits
without deploying. Check the direction of each diff before restoring anything.

## Verification ladder

Nothing here is fast. Budget for it.

| command | what it buys | rough time |
|---|---|---|
| `npx tsc --noEmit` (from `cells/drive`) | the only cheap check | ~30s |
| `node devtools/boot.mjs` | the world boots and probes exist | ~1min |
| `node devtools/lab.test.mjs` | every lab opens, dials persist and travel | ~6min |
| `node devtools/fixture-world.test.mjs` | the whole mesh pipeline over authored ground | ~7min |
| `node devtools/<name>.test.mjs` | 66 of them; pick what you touched | varies |

Run them from `/home/user/workspace`, not from the cell directory.

**`tsc` failure is silent if you pipe it.** `npx tsc --noEmit 2>&1 | head && echo OK`
prints OK on failure, because `head` succeeds. Use `;` not `&&`, and read the
output.

### Tests that fail for reasons that are not you

`sward.test.mjs` and anything else that needs a road under the car depend on
**Overpass**, a busy public service that fails for whole sessions at a time.
Its road/water masking checks fail in a family and the count moves run to run.
Before blaming a change, stash it and run the test on the parent commit. Say
plainly which failures are environmental rather than claiming green.

## The harness

`devtools/harness.mjs` → `openDrive({spot, pagePath, tag, settle, bootTimeout})`.
Its own header documents two traps in detail; the short version:

- **Chromium cannot use the agent proxy.** Every https request is intercepted
  and relayed through `curl` with a SHA1 disk cache. A cold run takes minutes,
  a warm one seconds.
- **The relay bypasses CSP**, so these tools are structurally blind to CSP
  bugs. A blocked host looks like a working one. Do not use the harness to test
  reachability.
- **Headless renders at 2–4 fps**, so wall time is not sim time. Anything that
  integrates must wait on `simWait`, never a timeout.

Other harness facts learned the hard way:

- Synthetic double-taps must dispatch **both** PointerEvents inside ONE
  `page.evaluate` — two separate calls exceed the 450ms window.
- `navigator.clipboard.readText()` **hangs** without permission in headless
  rather than failing. The dials panel mirrors COPY output to
  `root.dataset.lastCopy` for exactly this reason. A test that read the
  clipboard once stalled for ten minutes.
- Screenshots land in `/tmp/drive-tools/` (`$DRIVE_WORK`).
- A bundle built for a test must be written **inside the repo** (e.g.
  `node_modules/.cache`) — `--external:three` resolves from where the file
  lives, so a bundle in `/tmp` cannot find `three`.
- Never `pkill` a test by name from inside a compound command; it kills the
  enclosing shell and discards pending edits. (Yes, really.)

## Where the world comes from

Everything arrives through exactly **three fetches**, which is what makes the
fixture world possible:

| source | function in `main.ts` | zoom |
|---|---|---|
| terrarium height tile | `fetchHeights(x, y, z)` | z14 |
| WorldCover class tile | `loadCoverTile(x, y)` | z12 |
| OSM vector tile | `proxyTile(x, y)` / `readTileCache` | z16 |

Answer those three from an authored fixture and the **entire production
pipeline** runs with no network: terrain build, corridor carve, ribbon, batter,
kerb, junction, vegetation, sward, façades, water. That is `client/world-fixtures.ts`,
reached with `?fixture=<id>` and chosen from `/lab/world`.

---

## The labs

`/lab` lists them; each is `/lab/<slug>`, registered in `client/labs.ts`.

| slug | what it isolates |
|---|---|
| `hydro` | water fields, coastlines, river profiles |
| `marks` | the production façade shader and its graffiti |
| `roads` | the bench-search profile solver, as a section |
| `flora` | the climate ladder **and** a real stand of the shipping plants |
| `weather` | the 48×48 weather lattice, with time on a dial |
| `world` | a chooser: the whole engine over an authored planet |

**The rule that keeps a lab honest: it imports the SAME modules the game runs.**
A lab that reimplements what it is inspecting proves nothing about what ships.
This is why the façade shader became `client/facade.ts`, the plants became
`client/flora.ts` and the grain shader became `client/grain.ts` — each was
extracted *so that* a lab could drive the real thing.

Labs exist because in-world verification is unreliable: Overpass fails, and
finding a town, waiting for four tiles and hoping the camera comes to rest
facing the right wall is not a test. When something is invisible in the world,
three very different faults share one symptom — a placement bug, a streaming
failure, and a shader that silently failed to compile. A lab removes the world
from the question.

### The dials bargain

Every lab uses `createDials` from `client/lab-dials.ts`, and owes three things:

1. **Be liberal.** A number worth arguing about is worth a slider. The cost of
   one more dial is a row; the cost of a missing one is an edit-build-look
   cycle per guess.
2. **It survives a reload**, per lab, under `drive.lab.<slug>.dials`.
3. **It comes out as text.** `source:` writes a paste-ready engine literal;
   PASTE takes it back. Tuning that cannot leave the lab is a toy.

Group dials with `{kind: 'section'}` — the panel and each section fold, and the
fold state lives under a separate `drive.lab.<slug>.fold` key so it never rides
along on the clipboard. Folding sets `--dials-w: 0`, which lab layouts should
lay out against instead of a hard gutter.

## Rendering doctrine

**The post pipeline governs every visual decision.** The composite quantises to
14 levels and Bayer-dithers at *display* resolution, then magnifies with
nearest-neighbour. Consequences that are not negotiable:

- Prefer **binary alpha**, flat stepped tones and hard edges.
- Narrow bright features become white contour diagrams. Avoid them.
- The bloom cut is **0.62** — anything above it glows. "White paint at midnight
  is a bug": every emissive thing takes a daylight factor.
- One palette step is about **0.07 sRGB**. Anything subtler is eaten by the
  quantiser or smeared into the dither, so texture must be coarse and
  high-contrast to survive. This is why `grain.ts` pushes three octaves through
  a gamma under one.
- Per-fragment work is the **cheap** resource here (the frame is ~148×320);
  per-vertex and per-draw work is the scarce one. Procedural beats textured.

**GLSL ES 1.00**: dynamic indexing of a uniform array in a fragment shader is
illegal. Use a lookup texture. (`markTins` in `facade.ts` is the worked
example.)

**A backtick inside a GLSL comment breaks the enclosing TS template literal.**
This has now cost three separate rounds. Do not write `\`f\`` in shader
comments.

## Big shapes worth knowing

- **`client/main.ts` is ~36k lines** and holds the world's module state. Do not
  refactor it casually, especially while another agent is editing the cell.
  Extraction is right when the code is **pure** (flora, grain, facade,
  graffiti, culture, climate); it is wrong for anything wired into module state
  (`ribbon()` is ~1,800 lines and stays put).
- **Culture seeds** (`culture.ts`) are a hierarchy keyed on lat/lon, so they
  survive a world rebase: region 96km / district 6km / settlement 320m /
  stand 32m, as jittered Voronoi cells.
- **Buildings batch per tile**, so anything per-building must travel as a
  vertex attribute (`aBase`, `aMark`).
- **`__census()`** reports meshes by name — so name your meshes, or they arrive
  as `unnamed` and no audit can be written as an assertion.
- **Probes** are `window.__*` functions; `__hydro`, `__census`, `__fixworld`,
  `__demsrc`, `__built`, `__site` and dozens more. Add one when a question took
  more than one round to answer.
- **Dial records** live in `localStorage` under `drive.dials` with a `v` stamp.
  `saveDials` persists the WHOLE rack on any change, so a stored `0` does not
  mean anyone chose it — changing a default needs a version bump and a
  migration in `loadDials`, exactly like the TIME remap (v2), the PALETTE shift
  (v3) and the WATER default (v4).

## House style

- Comments explain **why**, in prose, often at length, and frequently record
  the failure that motivated the code. Match that density; it is the point.
- British spelling in prose and identifiers (`colour`, `metre`).
- Never put a model identifier in a commit message, code comment, or anything
  else pushed to the repository.
- Report outcomes faithfully. If a test fails, say so with the output; if a
  check was skipped or interrupted, say that rather than implying green.
